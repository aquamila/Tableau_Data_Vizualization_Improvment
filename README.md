# Capstone Project

## Overview

The main goal of this project is to describe how I have improved an existing data visualization from Makeover Monday, using everything I have learned throughout the course.

I analyzed the Tableau data visualization based on the [data .world](https://data.world/)’s dataset and visualization [Violence Against Women & Girls — perceptions in African, Asian, and South American countries](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w10). 

I shared all the steps in [the post on Medim](https://aquamila.medium.com/udacity-data-visualization-nanodegree-capstone-project-7f9714c0a903).

The improved data visualization is [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/UDACITY_DVND_Capstone_LiudmilaSemenova/ViolenceAgainstWomen?:language=en&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link). 

## Data

The main dataset is [violence_against_women.csv](https://github.com/aquamila/UDACITY_DVND_Capstone-Project/blob/master/https://github.com/aquamila/UDACITY_DVND_Capstone-Project/blob/main/violence_against_women.csv) that contains information about the percentage of of people in 70 countires who agree that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under the six specific circumstances.

Data Dictionary:

**Gender**	- whether the survey respondents were men or women;  
**Demographic Question** and **Demographic Response** - the demographic features which group survey respondents by marital status, education level, employment status, residence type and age (15–24; 25–34; 35–49);<br>
