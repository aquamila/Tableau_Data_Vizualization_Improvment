# Existing Tableau Data Visualization Improvement 
# Violence Against Women

## Overview

The main goal of this project is to describe how I have improved an existing data visualization from Makeover Monday, using everything I have learned throughout the course.

I analyzed the Tableau data visualization based on the [data .world](https://data.world/)’s dataset and visualization [Violence Against Women & Girls — perceptions in African, Asian, and South American countries](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w10). 

I shared all the steps in [the post on Medium](https://aquamila.medium.com/udacity-data-visualization-nanodegree-capstone-project-7f9714c0a903), the copy of the post on Github is [here](https://github.com/aquamila/UDACITY_DVND_Capstone-Project/blob/main/post.md).

The improved data visualization is [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/UDACITY_DVND_Capstone_LiudmilaSemenova/ViolenceAgainstWomen?:language=en&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link). 

## Data

The main dataset is [violence_against_women.csv](https://github.com/aquamila/UDACITY_DVND_Capstone-Project/blob/master/https://github.com/aquamila/UDACITY_DVND_Capstone-Project/blob/main/violence_against_women.csv) which contains information about the percentage of people in 70 countries who agree that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under the six specific circumstances.
